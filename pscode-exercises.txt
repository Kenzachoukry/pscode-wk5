// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers
BEGIN
set n1, n2, sum 
read n1, n2
sum = n1+n2
print ("Total: ", sum)
END
// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
BEGIN 
Input n1
if n1%2 == 0 
  print "even"
else 
  print "odd"
END

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    
a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) 
BEGIN
Input n1, n2, n3, n4, n5
b) Avg =(n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5
c)
min = n1
max = n1
#creating conditions for min number
if n2 < min:
    min = n2
if n3 < min:
    min = n3
if n4 < min:
    min = n4
if n5 < min:
    min = n5
#creating conditions for max number
if n2 > max:
    max = n2
if n3 > max:
    max = n3
if n4 > max:
    max = n4
if n5 > max:
    max = n5

# Printing the results
print("Average: ", avg)
print("Minimum: ", min)
print("Maximum: ", max)
