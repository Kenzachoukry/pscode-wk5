// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers
BEGIN
set n1, n2, sum 
read n1, n2
sum = n1+n2
print sum 
END
// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
BEGIN 
set n1
if n1%2 == 0 
  print "even"
else 
  print "odd"
END

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    
a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Begin
Number n1, n2, n3, n4, n5
Input n1, n2, n3, n4, n5
Avg =(n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5
min = 

print avg
print smallest
print largest
